<p>One of the things I’ve been exploring over the past year or so is code. I started playing around with online courses about a year ago but wasn’t making a lot of progress. In the fall of 2017 I enrolled in a fantastic Modern Web course at The Factory, in downtown Grand Rapids. This course is really what helped me see how good code can transform a user experience and made me start thinking that I wanted to transition to a job in the tech sector. </p>
<p>My next move was to enroll in the Part-Time Front End Development bootcamp through Grand Circus. This course was an intensive 10 week program in the evenings during the week, and all day Saturday on the weekends. I can’t tell you how much of a difference how much devoting that much time to something can quickly improve a skill set. I went from barely being able to navigate my text editor to building a web app with a couple of classmates.
</p>
<p>I just graduated from this course at Grand Circus, and am ready to dig into new projects. The past year has been such an exciting challenge, and I can’t wait to see what comes next.
