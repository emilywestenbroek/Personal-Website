It can be easy to underestimate what a program or site is capable of, but as this
article on various types of character animations shows, there are all sorts of ways
to up your game! Animations can be as simple as using a png image and CSS animation,
or using Skeletal Animation, as this post details. I'm not quite there yet, but I
am actively looking for a 30-100 day CSS code challenge so I can learn and practice
CSS images and animations.
