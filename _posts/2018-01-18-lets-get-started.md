I love the idea the the more we know, the more we realize how much we don't know.
Maybe that's why over the past year or so I've slowly been learning more about code,
the tech world in general -- but I realize I've only dipped my toes in the water.
I want to continue to seek out as much information as I can, and put that knowledge
into practice as best I can. This site is my way of testifying to the things I learn,
and the ways I'm growing. Let's get started.
