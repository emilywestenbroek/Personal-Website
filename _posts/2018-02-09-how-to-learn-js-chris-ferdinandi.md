I listened to this episode of JavaScript Jabber today and really liked the guest, Chris Ferdinandi's
outlook on learning a coding language. I appreciated how he educates from the perspective that the
internet is for everyone. I also thought his perspective on learning the vanilla version
of any language should be encouraged so as to fully understand that language's functionality.
