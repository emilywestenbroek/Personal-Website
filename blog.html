<h2 class="blog-title">Blog</h2>
<p>There's so much to learn out there, and I'm excited to keep exploring. This is where
I share some of the things I've encountered lately.</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <article class="blog">
        <h2><a class="blog-link" href="{{ post.link }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
        {{ post.content }}
      </article>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
